# LIVE FINGER DETECTION
My project involves Image recognition which plays a crucial role in the field of computer vision. Popular Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) are majorly trained and tested against large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MNIST. As part of this
project, I created a new dataset which I hope that others will contribute to in the future. At macro level my project has three components:
first, I created a data set which consists of approximately 5000 images of fingers counting from 1 to 5, secondly, I designed and trained a
Deep Convolutional Neural Network on my dataset which classifies finger counts with a high accuracy when validated against the test set
randomly extracted from the dataset. Finally, we created a live detection platform which can classify a finger count through the webcam.
